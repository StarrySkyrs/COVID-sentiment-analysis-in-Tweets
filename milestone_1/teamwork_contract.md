# Teamwork Contract

1. How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?
We will first divide the work equally into parts based on the difficulty level and the estimated amount of time to finish, and then people can choose the part they would like to work on.  	

2. What are the expected work hours for the project?
Each person is expected to spend at least 20 hours per week on the group project.

3. How often will group meetings occur (here is a nice article on meetings)? 
We will meet at least twice a week together (through slack calls, zoom meetings etc.), one on Tuesdays in the lab ideally with a TA, and the other one in the middle of the week (tentatively on Friday at 12pm). Small group meetings will also happen if people are collaborating.

4. Will you have meeting agendas and minutes?
Yes. We will set up meetings beforehand and have a checklist about the things we are going to discuss during the meeting. 

5. What will be the style of working? 
Everyone can choose to work independently or collaboratively based off their preference, but we are going to help if anyone is stuck. Everyone will definitely prioritize the group work and make sure we meet the deadline.
 
6. Will you use daily "stand-ups", or submit a written summaries of your contributions, or something else?
The summaries of contributions are going to be the same as our work division.

7. What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?
We expect the quality to be as the best each team member could do. 

8. When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations). Will you have someone who acts as the project manager (i.e. keeps things on track) for the entire project, or each milestone, or be entirely democratic throughout the project?
We will be entirely democratic throughout the project because the general meetings are set to time that everyone is free and if some team members are not available with ad-hoc meetings, we will have post-meeting summaries posted on slack, so they can still catch up by reading summaries.   

9. Is there any behavior you wish to highlight as being expected or unacceptable (i.e., what is the code of conduct for the group?) 
We should be respectful, responsive, responsible and reachable on slack. 

10. And any other similar things that govern your working relationships.
No at this time.


The above is adapted from my previously written teamwork contract for the course 523 and is proven to be a good one to follow.
